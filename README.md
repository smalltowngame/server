# Smalltown

The werewolf card game done as web app with php server side and mysql server.
See it in action : [sml.town/game](http://sml.town/game)

## Usage

You cad add this game into your webpage with a simple: 

```$("#divId").load(gameUrl + "index.php");```

**Smalltown is not only a php game, it's a framework to make card games.**

Inside "games" path can be added different card games but only "mafia-werewolf" is now available. It can be added too more cards rules inside cards folder.

Until now I made the next cards: werewolf, seer, witch, cupid, hunter, angel, and a different way to play girl.

This game can be played on an android device with game "The Werewolf (Small Town)" found on the google play store for free.
With a lot of extra utilities, the most important: players will wake up with a soft vibration (customizable).

(To make it simpler to run, a jquery library is inside the project.)
